        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of our simpler recipes: basted eggs. As a deviation from our more sweeter recipes, we will provide something
            a little more salty. These eggs are a perfect breakfast and do not take long to make at all. With a combined prep
            and cook time of about 10 minutes, this recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites
            and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and lessy fussy.
