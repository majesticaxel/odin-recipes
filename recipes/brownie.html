        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This brownie recipe is another one to add to your arsenal. While this recipe takes a little longer to make, you
            will not be dissapointed with the results. The prep time for these brownies is about 25 minutes plus the time it 
            takes to cook. This may not seem like a long time but straight out the oven is probably not the best way to eat it!
            It will be too hot to eat so a cooling time of 30 minutes should be just enough.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>32 chocolate sandwich cookies (Oreo), divided</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip), thawed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture and
                mix until well combined
            </li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with a spatula. Add 16 OREO cookies in an
                even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies), then spread the remaining 1/2 of the batter over top.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crush 12 of the remaining OREO cookies. Place the whipped topping in a bowl and fold in the crushed cookies.
                Spread over the top of the cookies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies, then sprinkle over the top of the
                whipped cream mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Keep refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
