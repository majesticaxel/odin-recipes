    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Chocolate Banana Bread has its own sweet twist with chocolate chips, cocoa, and just a hint of sour cream. 
        This adds a tang of extra sweetness that can satisfy your craving with just one bite. The time to prepare is quick and easy
        and should only take around 10 minutes to complete. Once you have it in the oven, it should sit for another 1 hour after
        preheating to 340 degrees F. It will be enough to for a group wanting just a simple snack or after-dinner dessert. After
        baking it yields two 9x5 inch loaves of bread.
